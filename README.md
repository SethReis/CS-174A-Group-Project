### Interactivity
Move left/right/forward/backward with the WASD keys and jump with the spacebar.

Look around by first clicking on the inner screen to use the mouse. The player’s maximum/minimum up/down rotation is limited to prevent flipping the camera. 

Toggle the flashlight off/on with a sound cue by pressing the ‘F’ key.

Easy, Medium, and Hard buttons on the control panel to generate a new maze with varying difficulty.

Adjust mouse sensitivity under Movement Controls.

### Goal
A Speedrun game! Reach the portal at the end of the maze to record your first completion time. You will be sent back to the start of the same maze to improve your Best Time.

### Obstacles
Beware of rats scattered around the maze–they will BITE you if you touch them. Rats are silent and difficult to spot, so be sure to use your flashlight and don’t let them approach you from behind! Luckily, they move rather slowly and are small enough to jump over.

You regain health after completing a successful run, but once your health % reaches 0, you’ll be sent to the start of a new maze. As such, do your best to not get hit if you’d like to improve your Best Time.
