Interactivity
Move left/right/forward/backward with the WASD keys and jump with the spacebar.
Look around by first clicking on the inner screen to use the mouse. The player’s maximum/minimum up/down rotation is limited to prevent flipping the camera. 

Toggle the flashlight off/on with a sound cue by pressing the ‘F’ key
Easy, Medium, and Hard buttons on the control panel to generate a new maze with varying difficulty.

Adjust mouse sensitivity under Movement Controls

Goal
Get to the portal at the end of the maze to record your completion time and get sent back to the beginning.
After completing the maze, you will be sent back to the start of the same maze, so try your best to get a better time.

Obstacles
There are many rats strewn about the maze that will damage you if you touch them. Be sure to use your flashlight to pick them out, and watch out for them sneaking up from behind! (There is a sound effect when you are hit.)
Your health does not refill after entering the portal and completing the maze, and once you run out of health, you’ll be sent to the start of a new maze. As such, do your best to not get hit if you’re going for a good time.
